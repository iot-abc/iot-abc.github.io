{"name":"Internet Of Things","tagline":"Learn about IoT from ABC to XYZ","body":"### Welcome to IoT ABC to XYZ.\r\nThis site serves as the book-site for the book which we are currently working on. Our book is titled Learning IoT using Particle Photon and Electron. It will be released in January, 2016 and we are working hard to make the book an awesome read for first time IoT hackers as well as seasoned enthusiasts.\r\n\r\n### What will this site do?\r\nWe will be publishing our update on the book on this site which will help you track the progress. Additionally, we will add a blog about IoT mostly focussing on getting things to work and trouble-shooting. From the time we started working on the book, we realised that debugging hardware devices are very difficult and often finding the right documentation or step is difficult. We will also be posting videos, photos and texts about the projects we build in our free-time which will serve as starting point for you guys!\r\n\r\n### What do we hack on?\r\nWe work on number of devices ranging from resistors to [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com). For the book, we are using [Particle](https://www.particle.io) products; Photon, Core and Electron. We are working [CylonJS](http://www.cylonjs.com) to integrate everything around us to fulfil the vision of IoT or rather IoE (Internet of Everything). We love to hack and build awesome prototypes. Our technology stack starts from the low-level networking protocol [CoAP](http://coap.technology), [MQTT](http:mqtt.org) to all the way to [Node JS](https://www.nodejs.org). We <3 [Angular JS](https://www.angularjs.org) and use mostly for building web dashboards. Our favourite database store has been [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) with [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as the server.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRashid Khan(@rashoodkhan) is an IoT enthusiasts who loves Python, Django and JavaScript. He has been contributor to various open-source projects. More details about him can be found on his [site](http://www.imrashid.com). You can find him on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/WorkaholicKhan) sending off random tweets about his hacks or lets his bots tweet ;)\r\n\r\nKajari holds a PhD in [Wireless Sensor Networks](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1548&context=etd) and loves to hack and create new platforms for supporting IoT.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nWe are still setting up the official email accounts for the book-site to handle queries and suggestions. In the meantime you can contact Rashid on his personal Email ID [rashid@imrashid.com](mailto:rashid@imrashid.com).\r\n","google":"UA-67367702-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
